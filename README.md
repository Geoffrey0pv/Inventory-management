**Problem Definition:**

The company XYZ, dedicated to the production and commercialization of kitchen utensils, has 12 SKUs. Half of them are for purchase and sale, while the other half are manufactured and marketed (production weekly rates are located in the Excel file). These 12 references are grouped into 4 product categories. Each one has historical demand records for 90 weeks, which have been analyzed by the team using time series forecasting models.

**Data Description:**

The database includes the accumulated effective inventory at the end of each week, representing the total units available for each reference across all storage points for finished products. Additionally, it includes orders placed at the end of each week and the quantities received or produced at the end of each week. It is assumed that these items become available for sale at the beginning of the following week, accounting for any accumulated delays if necessary.

In the "characterization" sheet, other essential data is presented. For example, unit costs for each reference or SKU, the percentage charges for holding inventory per monetary unit for a year, and the fixed ordering cost for either purchasing or production activities. The unit shortage cost is assumed as a percentage of the expected margin for each product with an additional penalty factor (multiplicative) for loss of goodwill. It is noted that shortages or negative inventories generate backorders but no lost sales.

**Inventory Replenishment Recommendations**

Given that costs remain constant over time (for the 90 weeks and beyond), the company seeks well-supported recommendations from its consulting team regarding inventory replenishment policies, both on an individual item basis and aggregated into groups. These groups share the same supplier for purchase and sale items (a different supplier for each group) and share production resources for manufactured items.

The expectation is to obtain a comparison of total inventory costs between weeks 61 to 90 of the current situation versus the estimated costs of the policies recommended by the team for the same time window. Additionally, a simulated model of the performance of forecast-based policies and their uncertainties for the next 13 weeks (weeks 91 to 103) could be included. The company aims to achieve service levels between 95% and 98% of not incurring shortages for each item.

**Volume Purchase Discounts and Warehouse Capacity Recommendation**

Additionally, the company wishes to determine if negotiating discounts for larger volume purchases is justified for the 6 purchase and sale references. What can be proposed in this regard? Finally, if 58% of the aggregate finished product inventory is concentrated in a single storage center, what capacity is recommended?
